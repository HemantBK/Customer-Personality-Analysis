# Customer-Personality-Analysis - Readme

This repository contains the code and documentation for a data science project. The project focuses on customer personality analysis and involves analyzing customer data to gain insights into customer segments.

### Project Overview
The goal of the project is to help businesses better understand their customers by performing a detailed analysis of their ideal customers' personalities. This analysis allows businesses to modify their products and marketing strategies according to the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of different customer segments.

The project involves the following steps:

1) Data Preprocessing: The raw customer data is processed and cleaned to ensure its suitability for analysis.
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The data is explored using various statistical and visual techniques to gain insights and identify patterns.
3) Model Building: Clustering techniques are applied to segment the customers based on their attributes and behaviors.
4) Customer Segmentation: The identified clusters are analyzed to understand the distinct characteristics of each customer segment.


### Project Structure
The project repository is organized as follows:

1) data/: This directory contains the dataset used for analysis (e.g., marketing_campaign1.xlsx).
2) notebooks/: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with the code for data preprocessing, EDA, and model building.
3) results/: This directory contains any generated output or results from the analysis.
4) docs/: This directory contains project documentation, including this readme file.


### Requirements
To run the code in this project, the following dependencies are required:

Python 3.x
